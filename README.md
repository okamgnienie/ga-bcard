Genetic algorithm powered birthday card, created for my friend.
It uses forty one characters long string as a representation of the individual's chromosome. Population counts twenty individuals. In every tenth of a millisecond two children are born from mate of the two strongest individuals and the two weakest die. Individuals are also randomly mutated with 50% chance of mutation of one gene. New generations are created, until one of the individual's chromosome will be equal to "Wszystkiego najlepszego dla Wikipedii! :)", then stats are displayed on the card.
